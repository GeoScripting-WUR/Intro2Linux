    - Running R and Python from the terminal
- Learn the basics of *Bash* scripting and know how to create a shell script

# Linux?!

*Linux* is a free and open-source operating system kernel. In this course we will be working with *Ubuntu*, which is the most popular *Linux distribution*. A Linux distribution is an operating system that is built upon the Linux kernel and includes plenty of handy programs for daily work.

There is a large variety of different Linux distributions. One that is handy for geo-information science work is OSGeo-Live, which is an Ubuntu-based distribution that has a wide range of free and open-source GIS and Remote sensing tools preinstalled.
See [this website](http://live.osgeo.org/) for more information.

These tools are also available in other distributions, but they have to be installed manually. A general-use distribution such as *Ubuntu* or *openSUSE* is more suitable for regular day-to-day tasks, since not having the unnecessary tools installed takes less space and makes it work faster. It is also easier to find help for them than for specialised distributions. So in this course we will use a customised Ubuntu distribution with only the tools needed for this course preinstalled.

This year the operating systems are hosted by the [SURFsara High Performance Computing cloud](https://userinfo.surfsara.nl/systems/hpc-cloud) and accessed over the internet.

## Why use a Linux distribution?

A Linux environment makes it much easier to install and combine a variety of open-source software, such as Python modules and GDAL, compared to other operating systems like Windows or macOS. In addition, open-source scientific software is often developed primarily for Linux (since that's what most supercomputers and servers run!), and so it tends to be more stable and have more features on Linux. Furthermore, at Wageningen University & Research PC labs, ArcGIS and ArcPy are installed on the Windows machines, and this Python version tends to cause conflicts with open-source Python modules and tools (e.g. GDAL, GEOS).

## Why cloud computing?

In the field of geo-information, the amount of available data is staggering. This *Big Data* is often too large to download and too intensive to process on a personal computer. Therefore data providers such as the European Space Agency and research organisations like SURFsara are now offering virtual machines (VM) running on their own cloud infrastructure for scientific purposes, so that this Big Data can be processed faster and more efficiently. These cloud VMs are typically running Linux distributions and have a whole lot of resources (processor cores, RAM, hard disk) available.

## Getting started with SURFsara cloud

First go to [https://ui.hpccloud.surfsara.nl/](https://ui.hpccloud.surfsara.nl/) and log in with the credentials that have been provided to you. Each student has a unique account. Then, click on your username and go to Settings. Click "Update SSH Key" and paste the public key you generated in the previous lesson into the text box, and click the "Update SSH Key" button.

**Hint**: the easiest way to find it is by running Git GUI, though Help → Show SSH Key. In the PC lab the SSH keys are stored on the *M:* drive, so they are unique to the WUR user account. If you want to access the cloud from your own device, you will need to update the SSH key in your SURFsara account to the one on your device.

Next, press "Change view" and set it to "user". From the Dashboard, go to Virtual Resources → Templates, select the "Ubuntu 16.04 GeoScripting" template and press "Clone". Give it a name you like: this will become your very own virtual machine. A *Template* is a set of settings for your virtual machine, including the number of cores, memory and hard disks.

You can run it already by clicking on it and pressing "Instantiate", then confirming the settings by pressing "Instantiate" again. You will see your virtual machine running in the Virtual Resources → Virtual Machines page.

There are two ways to log into your virtual machine: through a graphical interface using the *X2Go Client* software, and through a command line using *Git Bash*. We will mainly use the graphical interface in this course. To do that, launch *X2Go Client* on Windows, and the new session *Session Preferences* window will be opened automatically. Fill in the details as follows:

* Session name: Enter a descriptive name for your VM.
* Host: The IP address of your VM. It starts with "145.100" and you can see it on the right in the *Virtual Machines* page. You can also copy it fromt he "Network" tab after you click on the VM entry.
* Login: *ubuntu*
* SSH port: Leave at *22*
* Use RSA/DSA key for ssh connection: The path to the *M:\\.ssh\id_rsa* file (**not** *id_rsa.pub*).
* Session type: *XFCE*

In addition, in the *Connections* tab you can set the compression method to "4k-png". This is a lower-colour setting that saves bandwith and thus makes the desktop more responsive.

Press OK, and from here on you can press the bubble on the right-hand side to launch the dektop of the virtual machine. You will see a *Host key verification failed* warning; this is expected every time you launch a new VM, answer *Yes*. You might also see a warning about shared folders and printers; this is safe to ignore. Tturn off folder and printer sharing for the message to go away.

**Note**: To properly shut down your VM, open the X2Go Client window again, and press the *Terminate* button on the lower right part of the main pane. Then on the SURFsara website, select your VM, press the garbage can button, and select *Shutdown*. Remember to shut down VMs you don't need, as they take up precious resources from the cloud!

### Saving changes

If you change something, then restart the VM, you may notice that your changes have been lost. This is because by default VM hard drives are not persistent. You need to clone them and set them as persistent to make the changes stick.

To do that, go to the *Virtual Resources* → *Images* page on the SURFsara website. This is a list of hard disks available to your VMs. Select the *Ubuntu 16.04 GeoScripting* image, which is the operating system image, then click "Clone" and name it. Go back to the image listing, selected your cloned OS image, press on the three-dots button and choose "Make persistent".

You now have a persistent clone of the operating system. Now you need to tell the VM to use it. To do that, go to the *Templates* page, select the template and clone it. Select your cloned template and click *Update*. Go to the *Storage* tab and click on your cloned OS image, then click *Update* to confirm changes.

Now when you instantiate your cloned template, it will use the persistent image and allow you to make changes. In case something ever goes wrong with the VM, you can always delete the cloned image and reclone the original image to start fresh.

### Adding more space

The OS image only has 10 GiB of space. In case it is not enough, such as for processing large rasters, you can add an additional hard drive to your VM and store your files on it.

To do that, repeat the cloning and template editing process, but this time with the *User data* image. When editing your teplate file (you can keep updating the cloned template you already have), instead of replacing Disk 0, press the *Add another disk* button and choose your cloned *User data* image as Disk 1.

The space is then available in the *userdata* directory within your user directory (*/home/ubuntu/userdata*).

### File sharing

You might want to transfer files to or from the VM. There are two ways to do so. The more convenient method is to use *Network File System* (NFS) to access the VM drive as if it was a local hard drive. To do that, you need to establish a secure connection to the VM and map the network drive to your PC.

First, start *Git Bash*. This will open a terminal window. In it, enter: `ssh -N -L 2049:localhost:2049 -L 2050:localhost:2050 -L 111:localhost:111 ubuntu@<ip>` where `<ip>` is the IP address of your VM. This will establish a secure SSH connection to the VM on ports 2049, 2050 and 111. You can use this method for other applications and ports as well (such as to access RStudio Server on some VMs). When you are done, to disconnect the secure connection, press Ctrl+C in the Git Bash window.

To map the network drive, open My Computer, press the *Map Network Drive* button, and enter `localhost:/home/ubuntu/userdata` (again, use the IP of your VM). Double-clicking on the shortcut, you will see an empty folder. It is the */home/ubuntu/userdata* directory on the VM, and you can drag and drop files and folders to and from it. To disconnect, right-click on the network drive and click *Disconnect*, and close the *Git Bash* window that is running the `ssh` command.

Another method to tranfer files is using the *Secure File Transfter Protocol* (SFTP). It is a command-line program that comes with SSH. You can use it for transferring any file you can access using SSH, so it is not limited to prespecified directories like NFS is. So you can use it to get or send files outside of your *userdata* directory.

To use it, open *Git Bash* again, and enter: `sftp ubuntu@<ip>`. This will give you a prompt in which you can enter commands. Use `get <file>` to download files and `put <file>` to upload them, where `<file>` is the path to the file. You can change the directory you download the files to by using `lcd <path>`, and the directory you download from by using `cd <path>`. Enter `?` for a complete list of commands, `exit` to quit.

## Getting started on OSGEO-live

First open your computer, VMware workstation Player (as demonstrated in yesterdays lesson).

Second, login into your linux, try out Rstudio, and also open QGIS.

 Third, follow this overview presentation of what is possible within OSGEO-live: http://live.osgeo.org/en/presentation/index.html#/

**Question**: After browsing through the presentation you now have a better idea of what is available via this OS-GEO live Operating system. Now, can you explain what: 
    
    - OS-GEO live is?
    - What we can do with GDAL and GEOS (hint: see presentation?)?

# Using the terminal and command line

*Why using the terminal?*: Under Linux there are GUIs (graphical user interfaces), where you can point and click and drag, and hopefully get work done without first reading lots of documentation. The traditional Unix environment is a CLI (command line interface), where you type commands to tell the computer what to do. That is *faster and more powerful*, but requires finding out what the commands are ([more information about using the terminal](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal)).

There are many varieties of Linux (e.g. Ubuntu, Centos, RedHat, etc.), but almost all of them use similar commands that can be entered from a command-line interface terminal.

There are also many graphical user interfaces (GUIs), but each of them works differently and there is little standardization between them. Experienced users who work with many different Linux distributions therefore find it easier to learn commands that can be used in all varieties of Ubuntu and, indeed, in other Linux distributions as well.

**Question**: 

    - What are the advantages of using the terminal? Can you think of some examples?

## What is Bash?

`Bash`, the **Bourne-again-shell** (named after the author Stephen Bourne), scripting is one of the easiest types of scripting to learn, and is best compared to Windows `Batch` scripting via [DOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS). `Bash` is very flexible, and has many advanced features that you won't see in batch scripts.

However if you are a 'non-computer-savvy' person this won't mean a thing to you. Bash is the language that you will learn to love as much of everyday Linux life is done/can be done using the Terminal. You will soon learn that most things can be done through both GUI (Graphical User Interface) and CLI (Command Line Interface), however some things are more easily achieved from one or the other. For example, changing file permissions of a folder and all its sub folders is more easily achieved using cli instead of gui.

Bash, is the default shell on Linux and Mac OS X. Bash shell scripting, like also `R` or `Python`, allows multiple commands to be combined, facilitating automation.

A shell script (shell program) is a text file that contains commands that are interpreted by the shell (see below, we will learn how to write a shell script).

Each command can be linked in a script to combine several commands by providing the output of one as input to the other. Shell scripts can also contain the control structures common to the majority of programming languages (i.e. variables, logic constructs, looping constructs, functions and comments). The main distinction between shell programs and those written in C, C++, Java (to name but a few) is that shell programs are not compiled for execution, but are readily interpreted by the shell.

**Question** : 

    - What is a shell script?

## Launching the Shell: terminal!

Is not a "Terminator" but something really powerful because via the terminal you get access to the CLI and its default Bash interface. The terminal is the engine behind linux and mac and can also be installed on Windows via a program called [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com) which provide a Linux interface on Windows. **It is important as a geo-scripter to know about the Terminal as if will offer a lot of advantages**. The more you'll get into scripting the more you will encounter the words "terminal", "shell", "bash", etc.

## Some commands

We will discuss useful everyday commands, as well as going a bit more in depth into scripting and semi-advanced features of Bash. Bash is not only used to run programs and applications, but it can also be used to write programs or scripts.

Now, within OSGEO-live you can use the **keyboard Shortcut**: `Ctrl + Alt + T`, to launch the terminal. This will look like:

![terminal](figs/terminal.png)

Typing "man man" in the **terminal** will bring up the manual entry for the man command, which is a good place to start! You can launch the terminal via: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
man man
## scroll down to examples
## type 'q' to exit
```

"man intro" is especially useful - it displays the "Introduction to user commands" which is a well-written, fairly brief introduction to the Linux command line.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
man intro
```

Most common commands:

- `pwd`: checking your current working directory
- `cd`: change directory
- `cd ..`: move up one directory
- `mkdir`: creating folders
- `rm` or `rm -R`: deleting files or folders
- `sudo`: opening applications as root (super-user, `su`) which requires your `su` pasword
- `ls`: listing files in a folder
- `cp`: copy files e.g. for backing up things or just copying. We will use these command it the scripts below.


Note!: Tab completion works from the terminal which is super-handy so that you never need to write filenames etc.

Now type to bring you back to your home folder, and chech what your current working directory is.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
cd
pwd
```

This should looks as follows:

![cdpwd](figs/cd_pwd.png)

*Question*: What is the difference between `ls -l` and `ls -lh`?

Now, create the `Bash` folder (i.e. a folder that will contain our Bash Scripts)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mkdir Bash
```

It should now look like this:

![mkdir](figs/mkdir.png)


Now, try out some more commands:
- make a directory and remove it (e.g. `mkdir -R namedirectory).
- create an Rscript via Rstudio, and then remove it via the terminal using `rm filename.R`.
- create another file and copy it and then remove it, etc.:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
cp source_file dest_file
rm dest_file
```

- use `ls` commands and its options.

Read the `File & Directory Commands` section (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal) and let us know if you have questions about some commands. 

## Starting R or Python from the terminal

Starting and stopping R from the terminal (this will provide you the same within the `console` as in *Rstudio*:
```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
R ## just type R and then q() to exit
q()
```

![RinTerminal](figs/RinTerminal.png)

Starting and stopping python from the terminal:

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
python
exit()
```

## Scripting in the terminal

### Hello, world Bash script 
`Bash` is primarily a scripting language, so it would be a crime not to talk about scripting. Let's dive straight in with a `bash` script. More precisely the infamous "Hello World" script. You can create a bash script by opening your favorite text editor to edit your script and then saving it (typically the `.sh` file extension is used for your reference, but is not necessary. In our example, we will be using the `.sh` extension).

So let's get started. First, go to the `Bash` folder you just created. 
Within this folder create a simple text file using *Rstudio -> New File -> Text File* and call this file: `HelloWorld.sh` add the following text and save.

![execute](figs/rstudioshell.png)

```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
 #!/bin/bash         
echo "Hello, World"
```

The first line of the script just defines which interpreter to use (and where it is located). NOTE: There is no leading whitespace before #!/bin/bash. That's it, simple as that!'. To find out where your `bash` interpreter is located type the following in the terminal (this works also on a Mac terminal!):

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
which bash
```

Second, to run a bash script you first have to have the correct file permissions. We do this with `chmod` command in terminal (change mode) as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
chmod a+x ~/Bash/HelloWorld.sh   #Gives everyone execute permissions
```

More info about `chmod` (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions) for your future reference. Note: today is just an introduction to let you know what is possible so that you can find your way easier in the future.

Below is a summary of what we have done in the terminal:

```{r, eval=FALSE, engine='bash'}
echo "Go to the Bash folder"
cd Bash
echo "Check that the file is there using the ls command:"
ls
echo "Then change the permissions:"
chmod a+x HelloWorld.sh
echo "We can now run our first `Bash script`:"
./HelloWorld.sh
```

Hopefully you should have seen it print Hello, World!!! onto your screen. If so well done! That is your first `Bash` script (see below for a screenshot):

![BashScript](figs/Scripting.png)

**Question**: 

    - Why do we add `./` in front of the Bash script?

Note!: we can also access the Terminal from R using the `system()` function that can invoke a OS command:

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=TRUE}
## R code
setwd("Bash/") ## set the working director in R
print(system("./HelloWorld.sh", intern = TRUE)) ## set this command to the Terminal
```

### Bash script with a variable

Variables basically store information. You set variables like this (you can type this in the terminal). 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
var="FOO"
```

`var` can be anything you want as long as it doesn't begin with a number. "FOO" can be anything you want. To access the information from the variable you need to put a '$' in front of it like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
echo $var
```

Now create the following e.g. `variables.sh` script in the *Bash* folder and apply the `chmod a+x variables.sh` command on this script using the terminal.

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
#!/bin/bash
echo "Now with the read function"
clear
echo "Please enter your name"
read name
echo "Please enter your age"
read age
echo "Please enter your sex. Male/Female"
read sex
echo "So you're a $age year old $sex called $name"
```

You can run the script once it is *executable*:
```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
./variables.sh
```

** Question **:

    - Try it out yourself, and try to do a calculation of e.g. a + b as input variables

## Using the GDAL library from the terminal

We will learn more about GDAL in the later lessons. GDAL is a very powerful translator library written in C/C++ for raster and vector geospatial data formats.
Now via the terminal we can access GDAL directly!!! E.g. we can check out what the current version of GDAL is that is installed on our Linux OS:

Let's download a file from [The intro to raster lesson](https://geoscripting-wur.github.io/IntroToRaster/#raster-objects-manipulations):
Download the `gewata.zip` file from Github ([link](https://github.com/GeoScripting-WUR/IntroToRaster/raw/gh-pages/data/gewata.zip)) and unzip in the data folder. Type the following in the data folder:

You can write a shell script to do the following commands below but first type in the commands via the terminal to understand what is happening:

```{r, eval = TRUE, engine='bash'}
echo "the current GDAL version is:"
gdal-config --version
```

One of the easiest and most useful commands in GDAL is `gdalinfo`. When given an image as an argument, it retrieves and prints all relevant information that is known about the file. This is especially useful if the image contains additional tag data, as is the case with `TIF` files.

Using gdalinfo:

```{r, eval = TRUE, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
cd data
ls *.tif
gdalinfo -nomd -norat -noct LE71700552001036SGS00_SR_Gewata_INT1U.tif
```

Now let's calculate the NDVI via GDAL terminal by using the `gdal_calc.py`. For more information about [GDAL_calc](http://www.gdal.org/gdal_calc.html).


```{r, engine='bash', eval=TRUE}
cd data
cp LE71700552001036SGS00_SR_Gewata_INT1U.tif input.tif
echo "* all files in the directory"
ls
echo "* now apply gdal_calc: Command line raster calculator with numpy syntax"
gdal_calc.py -A input.tif --A_band=4 -B input.tif --B_band=3  --outfile=ndvi.tif  --calc="(A.astype(float)-B)/(A.astype(float)+B)" --type='Float32'
echo "* remove the input temporary file"
rm input.tif
```

Challenge:

- try to write to calculate the NDVI using the lines above in a nice and short shell script.
- Hint 1: `cd ../data` (to move back from the Bash folder and move into the data folder)
- Hint 2: No spaces are allowed and e.g. try to use `fn=$(ls *.tif)`


Let's now check if the range of the NDVI values makes sense, and make a nice script:
```{r, engine='bash', results='hide', eval =FALSE}
#!/bin/bash
echo "teamname"
echo "14 january 2015"
echo "calculate landsat ndvi"
cd ../data
fn=$(ls *.tif)
echo "The input file: $fn"
outfn="ndvi.tif"
echo "The output file: $outfn"
echo "calculate ndvi"
gdal_calc.py -A $fn --A_band=4 -B $fn --B_band=3  --outfile=$outfn  --calc="(A.astype(float)-B)/(A.astype(float)+B)" --type='Float32'
echo "look at some histogram statistics"
gdalinfo -hist -stats $outfn
```

More info here on the power of GDAL via the terminal:
http://www.gdal.org/ and `gdalinfo`

Handy functions are (See the examples at the bottom):

- `gdal_translate`: http://www.gdal.org/gdal_translate.html
- `gdalwarp`: http://www.gdal.org/gdalwarp.html

More info about `Bash` basics: https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Command-Substitution

Optional: if you are ready and want the learn more about using GDAL from the terminal. See here for another tutorial:
http://wiki.americaview.org/display/miview/Introduction+to+GDAL

## Excercise
Let's download a file from [The intro to raster lesson](https://geoscripting-wur.github.io/IntroToRaster/#raster-objects-manipulations).
Download the `gewata.zip` file from Github ([link](https://github.com/GeoScripting-WUR/IntroToRaster/raw/gh-pages/data/gewata.zip)) and unzip in the data folder.

Write a shell script that:

 - derives NDVI from the landsat *.tif file as NDVI.tif
 - resampels the NDVI tif file to pixels of 60 m
 - *Bonus*: reprojects this resampled file to Lat/long WGS84 (the projection code is: EPSG:4326)
 
    - Tip!!!: `gdalwarp -t_srs EPSG:4326 $fntemp $fnout`

Submit the text of your shell script via Blackboard in the "Script Review Center" before tomorrow (930u).
Make sure your script is clear and reproducible, and let it test by at least one other team. 
You can copy the code in the BlackBoard review center (the other team needs to make it excecutable in order to test it).

*Do not forget to add a teamname, and members and date of script at the top of your script.*
